# odin-rift

A library for the programming language [Odin](https://github.com/gingerBill/Odin) for interfacing with the Oculus Rift SDK. 

Currently a direct port of [http://www.charlesodale.com/c-hello-world-for-oculus-rift-cv1-dk2-sdk-1-3-0/](http://www.charlesodale.com/c-hello-world-for-oculus-rift-cv1-dk2-sdk-1-3-0/). 

Prints headset position and orientation once every 100 millisecond. 

Works for Odin commit "3e80411d374d3dd7fc90e22d4f900144cfb6ef3a" and the Oculus SDK version 1.13. Only works for Windows (as the SDK is Windows only at this moment).
